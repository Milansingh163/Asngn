    "<br>\n",
    "Python programming language was developed by Guido van Rossum. He started working on Python in December 1989 and released the first version of the language in February 1991. Van Rossum named the language after Monty Python, the famous British comedy group, and chose to emphasize code readability, using whitespace and simple English words to indicate code blocks, among other things."

    "<br>\n",
    "Python is a multi-paradigm programming language, meaning it supports multiple programming paradigms. The main paradigms supported by Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Imperative programming: This includes procedural programming and focuses on describing the steps the program must take to solve a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Object-oriented programming (OOP): This paradigm emphasizes the use of objects, which contain both data and methods, to structure the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Functional programming: This paradigm emphasizes the use of functions, mathematical operations that take input, process it, and return an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scripting: This type of programming is used for writing scripts, small programs that automate repetitive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "With its clean syntax and support for multiple programming paradigms, Python is often used for a wide range of tasks, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more."

    "The correct extension for a Python file is .py. This extension is used to indicate to the operating system and other tools that the file contains Python source code. When a file with the .py extension is executed, the Python interpreter reads the contents of the file and runs the code as a Python script.\n",

    "</h4><br>\n",
    "Python code is interpreted, not compiled. This means that when you run a Python script, the Python interpreter reads the code line by line and executes it immediately. The interpreter does not produce a separate executable file that can be run on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreted languages like Python are typically easier to develop and debug, as the code is executed immediately and you can see the results of your changes immediately. This makes the development process faster and more iterative, as you can make changes to the code, run it, and see the results without having to go through a separate compile and link step.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the trade-off is that interpreted code typically runs slower than compiled code, as the interpreter has to perform extra work at runtime to execute the code. To mitigate this, some implementations of Python use Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compiles the code to machine code dynamically at runtime, resulting in improved performance."

In this system, each object in Python has a count of the number of references (or \"pointers\") that point to it in memory. When the reference count of an object drops to zero, meaning there are no longer any references pointing to it, the memory occupied by that object is automatically deallocated and made available for other parts of the program to use.\n",

When such objects are found, they are automatically removed from memory.\n",
