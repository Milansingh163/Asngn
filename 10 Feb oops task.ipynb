    "<h3>Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode\n",
    "of file opening.</h3>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    " In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. The open() function returns a file object that can be used to read, write, and modify the contents of a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The open() function takes two arguments: the first argument is the filename, and the second argument is the mode in which the file should be opened. The different modes of file opening are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r' - Read mode: This mode is used to open a file for reading. The file pointer is positioned at the beginning of the file. If the file doesn't exist, it will raise a FileNotFoundError error.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w' - Write mode: This mode is used to open a file for writing. If the file already exists, it will truncate the file to zero length. If the file does not exist, it will create a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' - Append mode: This mode is used to open a file for writing, but the file pointer is positioned at the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it will create a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "'x' - Exclusive creation mode: This mode is used to open a file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, it will raise a FileExistsError error.\n",
    "\n",
    "'b' - Binary mode: This mode is used to open a file in binary mode, which is used for non-text files like image and audio files. This mode should be used in combination with any of the above modes by adding 'b' to the mode string.\n",
    "\n",
    "'t' - Text mode: This mode is used to open a file in text mode, which is used for text files. This mode is the default mode, and it can be used in combination with any of the above modes by adding 't' to the mode string.\n",
    "\n",
    "'U' - Universal newline mode(depricated)\n",
    "\n",
    "To open a file for both reading and writing, use the '+' character. For example, 'r+' will open a file for both reading and writing. Similarly, 'w+', 'a+', and 'x+' can be used to open a file for both reading and writing with the corresponding mode.\n",

    "<h3>Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file? </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "The close() function is used to close an open file in Python. It is important to close a file after you have finished working with it because it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Frees up system resources: When you open a file in your program, the operating system assigns resources to keep track of the file, including memory and CPU time. If you don't close the file, these resources will remain allocated to the file until the program terminates, even if the file is no longer needed. This can cause your program to run out of resources, slow down or crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensures data integrity: Closing a file ensures that any pending changes are written to the file before it is closed. If you don't close the file, some data may remain in memory and not be written to the file. This can cause data loss or corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Allows other programs to access the file: When you open a file, it is locked for exclusive use by your program. If you don't close the file, other programs will not be able to access or modify it until your program releases the lock.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these reasons, it is also considered good practice to close files when you are finished with them, as it is a good programming habit to release resources as soon as they are no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To close a file in Python, you simply need to call the close() method on the file object that you created when you opened the file. For example, if you opened a file called \"example.txt\" using the open() function, you would close the file like this:\n",
