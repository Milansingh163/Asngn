    "<p>\n",
    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. It indicates that something unexpected happened, and the program could not continue to execute normally.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "Exceptions can be raised by built-in functions, by user-defined functions, or by the Python interpreter itself. Some common types of exceptions include NameError, TypeError, ValueError, and ZeroDivisionError.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "On the other hand, a syntax error is a type of error that occurs when Python detects a violation of its syntax rules. Syntax errors occur when there is an error in the way the code is written, such as a missing colon, a misspelled keyword, or an unclosed string.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "The key difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter before the program is executed, whereas exceptions are raised during program execution. Syntax errors must be fixed before the program can be run, while exceptions can be handled by the program to prevent it from crashing. Additionally, syntax errors are always caused by a mistake in the code itself, while exceptions can be caused by a variety of factors, including user input and external factors such as network failures or file system errors.\n",
