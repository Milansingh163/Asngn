    "Tuples are a type of data structure in Python that are very similar to lists, but with one key difference: tuples are immutable, meaning that once they are created, their contents cannot be changed. This makes tuples ideal for situations where you need to store data that will remain unchanged throughout the course of your program. \n",
    "\n",
    "A tuple can be created in Python by enclosing data in parentheses () or by using the tuple() function. A tuple can contain any number of data types, including strings, integers, floats, and other tuples. In addition, a tuple can have any length, from a single item to a thousand items or more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike lists, tuples are immutable, meaning that once they are created, their contents cannot be changed. This makes them ideal for situations where you need to store data that will remain unchanged throughout the course of your program. Additionally, since tuples are immutable, they are slightly more efficient than lists, making them a good choice when efficiency is a priority.\n"
