    "<p>Supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning are all different types of machine learning techniques. The main differences between these types are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Supervised Learning: In supervised learning, the data is labeled, and the algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs based on these labeled examples. The goal is to learn a function that can predict the correct output for new inputs.

    "<h3>Q6. What is train, test and validation split ? Explain the importance of each term.</h3>\n",
    "<p>Train, test, and validation split is a common practice in machine learning where a dataset is divided into three separate sets: a training set, a test set, and a validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training set is used to train the machine learning model. The algorithm learns the relationship between the input features and the output target variable based on the examples in the training set. The goal is to optimize the model parameters to minimize the error on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test set is used to evaluate the performance of the model after it has been trained. The test set is typically not used during the training process and is used only once to estimate the generalization error of the model. This error indicates how well the model is likely to perform on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The validation set is used to fine-tune the model and avoid overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns to fit the training data too well, at the expense of generalization performance on new data. The validation set is used to select the best model among a set of candidate models. The validation set can also be used for hyperparameter tuning, which involves selecting the best values for the parameters that control the model's behavior.</p>\n",
    "<p>The importance of each term can be explained as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Training set: The training set is the most important part of the split because it is used to train the model. The model learns from the examples in the training set and adjusts its parameters to minimize the error on this set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Test set: The test set is used to estimate the generalization error of the model. The test set is a proxy for new, unseen data that the model is likely to encounter in the real world. The test set is used to evaluate the model's performance and to compare the performance of different models.\n",

    "<h3>Q7. How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection ?</h3>\n",
    "<p>Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is not given any labeled data, and its goal is to identify patterns or structure in the data without any prior knowledge. One of the main applications of unsupervised learning is anomaly detection, where the algorithm tries to identify unusual or abnormal data points in a dataset.</p>\n",
    "<p>Anomaly detection using unsupervised learning typically involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data preprocessing: The first step is to preprocess the data, which involves scaling and transforming the data to make it suitable for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Model training: Next, an unsupervised learning model is trained on the preprocessed data. There are several types of unsupervised learning algorithms that can be used for anomaly detection, including clustering algorithms like k-means, density-based algorithms like DBSCAN, and dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Anomaly identification: Once the model is trained, it can be used to identify anomalies in new data points. This is typically done by calculating a score or distance metric for each data point, which measures how different or unusual it is compared to the rest of the data. Data points with high scores are considered anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Threshold determination: Finally, a threshold is determined to decide which data points should be classified as anomalies. This threshold can be set based on domain knowledge, or by using statistical methods like the mean or median of the scores.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Overall, unsupervised learning can be a powerful tool for anomaly detection, as it allows us to identify unusual patterns or outliers in data without the need for labeled data or prior knowledge. However, the effectiveness of this approach depends on the quality of the data and the choice of algorithm and parameters.</p>\n"
